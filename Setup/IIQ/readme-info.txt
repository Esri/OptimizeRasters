2 new templates related to IIQ conversion have been introduced, they're (IIQ_to_COG_JPEG_Q85.xml, and IIQ_to_COG_DEF.xml)
The updated Templates folder plus the iiq2tiff folder are included within the IIQ.ZIP.
Please extract the ZIP contents to the root of the OptimizeRasters source files, i.e. at the root where the OptimizeRasters.py is kept.
